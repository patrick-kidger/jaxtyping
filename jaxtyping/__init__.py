    # do more with static type checkers.)

    # equivalent way we can fake this using typing annotations. (In some sense the
    # closest thing would be a `Protocol[T]` with no methods, but that's actually the
    # opposite of what we want: that ends up allowing nothing at all.)
    #
    # The good news for us is that static type checkers have an internal escape hatch.
    # If they can't figure out what a type is, then they just give up and allow
    # anything. (I believe this is sometimes called `Unknown`.) Thus, this odd-looking
    # annotation, which static type checkers aren't smart enough to resolve.
