Annotations of the following sorts are supported:
```python
a: PyTree
b: PyTree[LeafType]
c: PyTree[LeafType, "T"]
d: PyTree[LeafType, "S T"]
e: PyTree[LeafType, "... T"]
f: PyTree[LeafType, "T ..."]
```

These correspond to:

a. A plain `PyTree` can be used an annotation, in which case `PyTree` is simply a
    suggestively-named alternative to `Any`.
    ([By definition all types are PyTrees.](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html))

b. `PyTree[LeafType]` denotes a PyTree all of whose leaves match `LeafType`. For
    example, `PyTree[int]` or `PyTree[Union[str, Float32[Array, "b c"]]]`.

c. A structure name can also be passed. In this case
    `jax.tree_util.tree_structure(...)` will be called, and bound to the structure name.
    This can be used to mark that multiple PyTrees all have the same structure:
    ```python
    def f(x: PyTree[int, "T"], y: PyTree[int, "T"]):
        ...
    ```
    Structures are bound to names in the same way as array shape annotations, i.e.
    within the thread-local dynamic context of a [`jaxtyping.jaxtyped`][] decorator.

d. A composite structure can be declared. In this case the variable must have a PyTree
    structure each to the composition of multiple previously-bound PyTree structures.
    For example:
    ```python
    def f(x: PyTree[int, "T"], y: PyTree[int, "S"], z: PyTree[int, "S T"]):
        ...

    x = (1, 2)
    y = {"key": 3}
    z = {"key": (4, 5)}  # structure is the composition of the structures of `y` and `z`
    f(x, y, z)
    ```
    When performing runtime type-checking, all the individual pieces must have already
    been bound to structures, otherwise the composite structure check will throw an error.

e. A structure can begin with a `...`, to denote that the lower levels of the PyTree
    must match the declared structure, but the upper levels can be arbitrary. As in the
    previous case, all named pieces must already have been seen and their structures
    bound.

f. A structure can end with a `...`, to denote that the PyTree must be a prefix of the
    declared structure, but the lower levels can be arbitrary. As in the previous two
    cases, all named pieces must already have been seen and their structures bound.
