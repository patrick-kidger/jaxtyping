# Contributing

Contributions (pull requests) are very welcome! Here's how to get started.

---

First fork the library on GitHub.

Then clone and install the library in development mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username-here/jaxtyping.git
cd jaxtyping
pip install -e .
```

Then install the pre-commit hook:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

These hooks use Black and isort to format the code, and flake8 to lint it.

Now make your changes. Make sure to include additional tests if necessary.

Next verify the tests all pass:

```bash
pip install pytest cloudpickle
pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pytest
```

Then push your changes back to your fork of the repository:

```bash
git push
```

Finally, open a pull request on GitHub!
